CONST_HIS_AND=History:\nAndromeda is a constellation in the northern sky. It is named after Andromeda, the princess of a mythological kingdom Aethiopia in Greek mythology. It is most notable for containing the Andromeda Galaxy. It is sometimes called "the Chained Lady" or "the Chained Woman" in English, Mulier Catenata in Latin, al-Mar'at al Musalsalah in Arabic, as the mythological Andromeda was chained to a wall of rock before being rescued by Perseus. And it was also called Persea, "Perseus' wife", or Cepheis, "Cepheus' daughter", in Latin.\n\nObject:\n? And (Alpheratz / Sirrah): the brightest star in this constellation. It is a binary star with an overall apparent visual magnitude of 2.06m. \n? And was formerly considered common to both Andromeda and Pegasus , and designated as "Delta Pegasi (? Peg)". And it forms an asterism with ?, ?, and ? Peg known as the Great Square of Pegasus. 
CONST_HIS_APS=History:\nApus was one of twelve constellations created by Petrus Plancius from the observations of Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser and Frederick de Houtman and it first appeared on a 35-cm diameter celestial globe published in 1597 (or 1598) in Amsterdam by Plancius with Jodocus Hondius. Plancius called the constellation Paradysvogel Apis Indica; the first word is Dutch for 'bird of paradise', but the others are Latin for "Indian Bee"; "apis" (Latin for "bee") is presumably an error for "avis" or "bird". This confusion seems to have prompted a rename of two constellations: "Avis Indica" to "Apus" and the constellation of the bee, Apis, to Musca the fly.\nThe first depiction of this constellation in a celestial atlas was in Johann Bayer's Uranometria of 1603.\n\nObject:\nApus includes two impressive clusters, NGC 6101 and IC 4499, as well as a very unusual nebular structure IC 4633. 
CONST_HIS_AQL=History:\nAquila was one of the 48 constellations described by Ptolemy in Ancient Greece. It is also mentioned by Eudoxus in the 4th century BC and Aratus in the 3rd century BC. It is now one of the 88 constellations defined by the International Astronomical Union.\nThe constellation was also known as Vultur volans (the flying vulture) to the Romans, not to be confused with Vultur cadens which was the Romans' name for what is now known as Lyra.\nPtolemy catalogued nineteen stars jointly in this constellation and in the now obsolete constellation of Antinous, which was named in the reign of the emperor Hadrian (AD 117\u0096138), but sometimes erroneously attributed to Tycho Brahe, who catalogued twelve stars in Aquila and seven in Antinous. Hevelius determined twenty-three stars in the first, and nineteen in the second.\n\nObjects:\n? Aql (Altair): this multiple star system (3 components) has 0.77m and is of spectral type A7 V. It has a parallax of 0.23", and consequently is about eight times as bright as the Sun. \n? Aql (Alshain): its spectral type is G8 IV and it shines with an apparent brightness of 3.71m. Like Altair, it too is a multiple star system with three components. 
CONST_HIS_AQR=History:\nAquarius is sometimes identified with Ganymede, a beautiful youth in Greek mythology with whom Zeus fell in love and, in the disguise of an eagle (represented by the constellation Aquila) carried off to Olympus to be cup-bearer to the gods. The constellation of Crater is sometimes identified as his cup.\nAquarius has also been identified as the pourer of the waters that flooded the earth in the ancient Greek version of the Great Flood myth. As such, the constellation Eridanus the river is sometimes identified as a river being poured by Aquarius.\nAquarius may also, together with the constellation Pegasus, be part of the origin of the myth of the Mares of Diomedes, which forms one of The Twelve Labours of Heracles. Its association with pouring out rivers, and the nearby constellation of Capricornus, may be the source of the myth of the Augean stable, which forms another of the labours.\n\nObjects:\nGliese 876 is the first planetary system found around a red dwarf star. The planetary system has three planets, including one terrestrial planet 6-8 times the mass of Earth. \n91 Aquarii b is a planet found around the orange giant star. The mass is 2.9 times Jupiter and the semimajor axis of 0.3 AU. \nGliese 849 b is the first long-period Jupiter-like planet found around the red dwarf star. The semimajor axis is 2.35 AU and has mass of 0.82 Jupiter. 
CONST_HIS_ARI=History:\nIn Greek mythology, the constellation of Aries represents the golden ram that rescued Phrixos, taking him to the land of Colchis. Phrixos sacrificed the ram to the gods and hung its skin in a temple, where it was known as the Golden Fleece.\n\nObject:\n  --- 
CONST_HIS_AUR=History:\nAccording to one Greek myth, Auriga represents Hephaestus, the blacksmith god, who was lame and invented the chariot so as to easily travel wherever he wanted.[citation needed] In another Greek myth, Auriga is said to represent Myrtilus, the charioteer of King Oenomaus, and who sabotaged the king's chariot.\nAuriga might also represent the 10th Labour of Hercules. Together with the area of the sky that is deserted (now the new and extremely faint constellations Camelopardalis and Lynx), and the other features of the area in the Zodiac sign of Gemini (i.e. the Milky Way, and the constellations Gemini, Orion, and Canis Major), this may be the origin of the myth of the cattle of Geryon, which forms one of The Twelve Labours of Heracles.\nCapella is associated with the mythological she-goat Amalthea. It forms an asterism with the stars ? Aurigae and ? Aurigae, which are known as the Haedi (the Kids).\n\nObject:\n? Aurigae and ? Aurigae are peculiar binary stars. The orbital period of ? Aurigae is approximately 27 years, with an eclipse duration of about 18 months. The visible companion is a yellowish F-class supergiant. The type of the other star is not known. ? Aurigae has a period of 970 days, the primary is a K-class supergiant and the secondary is a B-class main sequence star. Both these systems present a rare stage of binary evolution, as the components are in a short and active evolutionary stage. 
CONST_HIS_BOO=History:\nExactly whom Bo?tes is supposed to represent is not clear. According to one version, he was a ploughman who drove the oxen in the constellation Ursa Major using his two dogs Chara and Asterion (from the constellation Canes Venatici). The oxen were tied to the polar axis and so the action of Bo?tes kept the heavens in constant rotation.\nBo?tes was also supposed to have invented the plough. This is said to have greatly pleased Ceres, the goddess of agriculture who asked Jupiter to give Bo?tes a permanent fixture in the heavens as a reward for doing this.\nAnother version portrays Bo?tes as a grape grower called Icarius, who one day invited the Roman god Bacchus, also called Dionysus, to inspect his vineyards. Bacchus revealed the secret of wine making to Icarius, who was so impressed by this alcoholic beverage that he invited his friends round to sample it. Having never tasted wine before, they all drank too much and woke up the next morning with terrible hangovers; and they made the mistaken assumption that Icarius had tried to poison them. It was decided that Icarius should pay the price with his own life, and he was swiftly murdered in his sleep. Bacchus placed Icarius in the stars to honor him.\nFollowing another reading the constellation is identified with Arcas, son of Zeus and Callisto. Arcas was brought up by his maternal grandfather Lycaon, to whom one day Zeus went and had a meal. To verify that the guest was really the king of the gods, Lycaon killed his grandson and prepared a meal made from his flesh. Zeus noticed and became very angry, transforming Lycaon into a wolf and gave back life to his son.\nIn the meantime Callisto had been transformed into a she-bear, by Zeus' wife, Hera, who was angry at Zeus' infidelity. When he was grown up, Arcas met with the she-bear and, since obviously he didn't recognize her as his mother, he began to chase Callisto. Callisto, followed by Arcas, sheltered herself in a temple, a sacred place whose profaners were convicted to death. To avoid such fate, Zeus decided to set them in the sky, Arcas as Bo?tes and Callisto as Ursa Major.\nThis is a rare version of the myth surrounding Ursa Major, as the myth usually holds that Arcas is transformed into a bear as well (becoming Ursa Minor), and in such versions Bo?tes has no part. Ursa Minor, and Ursa Major, are constellations whose identification only originated in later classical Greece, and in Rome, and as such Bo?tes kept separate associations dating from much earlier.\nBo?tes was considered to be Atlas by some ancient Greek legends, as well as those in other early Mediterranean cultures, since it takes an appropriate position in the sky (its arms near the pole star, but its body standing on/near the ecliptic). As such, together with earlier interpretations of other constellations in the zodiac sign of libra (i.e. of Draco (constellation), Ursa Major and Ursa Minor it may have formed the origin of the myth of the apples of the Hesperides, which forms part of The Twelve Labours of Herakles.\n\nObject:\n? Bo?tis, a relatively Sun-like star, has the massive hot Jupiter ? Bo?tis Ab. It is the fourth extrasolar planet discovered and is one of the most studied.\nBo?tes also hosts a large number of double stars suitable for viewing by amateur astronomers. 
CONST_HIS_CAP=History:\nDespite its faintness, Capricornus has one of the oldest mythological associations, having been consistently represented as a sea-goat for over three thousand years; its earliest representations are on tablets from ancient Babylon. The constellation may owe its antiquity to the fact that at that time, the northern hemisphere's Winter Solstice occurred while the sun was in Capricorn. The concern for the sun's rebirth might have rendered astronomical and astrological observation of this region of space very important.\nDue to the precession of the equinoxes, the December solstice no longer takes place while the sun is in Capricorn, but the astrological period called Capricorn begins at approximately the same time as the solstice. The sun's most southerly position, which is attained at the northern hemisphere's winter solstice, is now called the Tropic of Capricorn, a term which also applies to the line on earth where the sun is directly overhead at noon on that solstice.\nThe planet Neptune was discovered in this constellation by German astronomer Johann Galle, near Deneb Algedi (? Capricorni) on September 23, 1846, which is reasonable as Capricornus can be seen best at 4:00am in September.\n\nThis constellation is sometimes identified as Amalthea, the goat that suckled the infant Zeus after his mother Rhea saved him from being devoured by his father Cronos in Greek mythology. The goat's broken horn was transformed into the cornucopia or horn of plenty. Some ancient sources claim that this derives from the sun "taking nourishment" while in the constellation, in preparation for its climb back northward.\nHowever, the constellation is more often depicted as a goat with a fish's tail. One myth says that when the goat-god Pan was attacked by the monster Typhon, he dived into the Nile; the parts above the water remained a goat, but those under the water transformed into a fish.\nIn Sumer, the constellation was associated with the god Enki (Babylonian Ea), who brought culture out of the sea to humankind.\nThe apparent paucity of stars within Capricornus, and the contrasting abundance within Sagittarius (which contains the brightest part of the Milky Way, was given a mythological explanation in Ancient Greece: due to early Greek beliefs that sin accumulated throughout the year, causing the darkness to increase, together with the sun's descent and pause at the Solstice, the ancient Greeks referred to this area of sky as the 'Augean Stable', where they considered the sun stabled during the year.[citation needed] The cause of the association with the location or name of Augeas is not currently known. 
CONST_HIS_CMA=History:\nIn Europe, Canis Major has been associated with dogs from early times. The name of Sirius, its brightest star, means "scorching", since the summer heat occurred just after Sirius' heliacal rising. The Ancient Greeks referred to such times in the summer as dog days, as only dogs would be mad enough to go out in the heat, leading to the star being known as the Dog Star. Consequently, the constellation was named after it, as a 'Big Dog'.\n\nIn early classical Europe, Canis Major represented the dog Laelaps, a gift from Zeus to Europa; or sometimes the hound of Procris, Diana's nymph; or the one given by Aurora to Cephalus, so famed for its speed that Zeus elevated it to the sky.\nIt was also considered to represent Orion's hunting dog, pursuing Lepus the Hare or helping Orion fight Taurus the Bull; and is referred to in this way by Aratos, Homer and Hesiod. The ancient Greeks refer only to one dog, but by Roman times, Canis Minor appears as Orion's second dog.\nSirius was considered a dog in its own right, early Greek mythology sometimes the constellation to represent a two-headed dog. As such, together with the area of the sky that is deserted (now considered as the new and extremely faint constellations Camelopardalis and Lynx), and the other features of the area in the Zodiac sign of Gemini (i.e. the Milky Way, and the constellations Gemini, Orion, Auriga, and Canis Minor), this may be the origin of the myth of the cattle of Geryon, which forms one of The Twelve Labours of Heracles.\nRoman myth refers to Canis Major as Custos Europae, the dog guarding Europa but failing to prevent her abduction by Jupiter in the form of a bull; and as Janitor Lethaeus, the watchdog.\n\nObject:\nCanis Major's alpha star, Sirius, is the brightest object in Earth's sky after the Sun, Moon, Jupiter, and Venus. It is also one of the nearest stars to Earth. The star VY Canis Majoris (VY CMa) is a red hypergiant star in Canis Major. It is the largest known star and also one of the most luminous known. It is located about 1.5 kiloparsecs (or 5,000 light-years) from Earth. 
CONST_HIS_CAR=History:\nCarina (pronounced /k??ra?n?/), is a constellation in the southern sky. Its name is Latin for the keel of a ship, and it was formerly part of the larger constellation of Argo Navis (the ship Argo) until that constellation was divided in three.\n\nObject:\nCarina contains Canopus, the second brightest star in the night sky, and the supermassive star ? Carinae which is embedded in the giant Eta Carinae Nebula (NGC 3372). 
CONST_HIS_CAS=History:\nCassiopeia is a constellation in the northern sky. In Greek mythology it was considered to represent the vain queen Cassiopeia, who boasted about her unrivaled beauty. It was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 1st century Greek astronomer Ptolemy, and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations today. Cassiopeia is easily recognizable due to its distinctive 'W' shape formed by five bright stars.\n\nObject:\nCassiopeia contains two stars visible to the naked eye that rank among the most luminous in the galaxy: ? Cas and V509 Cas. The star ? Cas is a nearby (19.4 ly) binary star comprising a yellow Sun-like dwarf and an orange dwarf star.\nTwo Messier objects, Messier 52 (NGC 7654) and Messier 103 (NGC 581) are located in Cassiopeia. Both are open clusters and being 7th apparent magnitude objects they are easy targets with binoculars. 
CONST_HIS_CEN=History:\nMentioned by Eudoxus in the 4th century BC and Aratus in the 3rd century BC, Centaurus is an ancient constellation. Large as it is now, in earliest times it was even larger, as the constellation Lupus was a sectional asterism within Centaurus as an unspecified animal considered to be either in the centaur's grasp or impaled on its spear. The Southern Cross, which now is pictured as overlaying the centaur's lower hind legs, was also originally a mere asterism formed of the stars composing those legs. Additionally, what is now the minor constellation Circinus was then just random stars under the centaur's front hooves. In the 1st century CE, Ptolemy catalogued thirty-seven stars in Centaurus.\nWhile Centaurus now has a high southern latitude, at the dawn of civilization it was an equatorial constellation. Precession has been slowly shifting it southward for millennia, and it is now close to its maximal southern declination. Thousands of years from now it will, once again, be at lower latitudes and be visible worldwide.\n\nCentaurus has traditionally been identified as a centaur, a mythological creature, half man, half horse. According to the Roman poet Ovid (Fasti v.379), the constellation honors the centaur Chiron, who was tutor to many of the earlier Greek heroes including Heracles (Hercules), Theseus, and Jason, the leader of the Argonauts. This is unusual, as most authorities consider Sagittarius to be the civilized Chiron, while Centaurus represents a more uncouth member of the species. If Centaurus represents Pholus, then in combination with Lupus, the constellation may have formed the basis of the myth of the Erymanthian Boar, one of the Twelve Labours of Heracles.\n\nObject:\nCentaurus contains the Alpha Centauri system, a triple star system consisting of a bright binary star to which the much fainter red dwarf Proxima Centauri is gravitationally bound; Proxima is the nearest known star to the Sun. 
CONST_HIS_CEP=History:\nTogether with other constellations nearby (Andromeda, Perseus, Cassiopeia, and possibly Pegasus), and the constellation Cetus below Cepheus, this may be the source of the myth of the Boast of Cassiopeia, with which it is usually identified.\n\nObject:\n? Cephei is a binary star approximately 50 light years away from Earth. The system consists of an orange subgiant and a red dwarf. Due to the precession of the equinoxes, ? Cephei will be the pole star between AD 3000 and 5200, with the closest approach to the north celestial pole around AD 4000. The primary component is orbited by a planet. 
CONST_HIS_CET=History:\nCetus is a constellation in the northern sky. Its name refers to Cetus, a sea monster in Greek mythology, although it is often called 'the whale' today. Cetus is located in the region of the sky known as the Water, along with other watery constellations such as Aquarius, Pisces, and Eridanus.\n\nObject:\nThis constellation's most notable star is Mira (or ? Ceti), the first variable star to be discovered. Over a period of 331.65 days it can reach a maximum magnitude as high as 2.0m, one of the brightest in the sky and easily visible to the unaided eye, then drop to 10.1m and back again. Its discovery in 1596 by David Fabricius further dented the supposed unchangeability of the heavens and lent support to the Copernican revolution. 
CONST_HIS_CRU=History:\nCrux was visible to the Ancient Greeks, who regarded it as part of the constellation Centaurus. At the latitude of Athens in 1000 BC, Crux was clearly visible, though low in the sky. However, the precession of the equinoxes gradually lowered its stars below the European horizon, and they were eventually forgotten by the inhabitants of northern latitudes. By AD 400, most of the constellation never rose above the horizon for Athenians.\nCrux was rediscovered by Europeans during the Age of Discovery. Amerigo Vespucci mapped Alpha Centauri and Beta Centauri as well as the stars of modern Crux on his expedition to South America in 1501.\nThe separation of Crux from Centaurus is generally attributed to the French astronomer Augustin Royer in 1679. Other historians attribute the invention of Crux to Petrus Plancius in 1613, noting that the constellation was later published by Jakob Bartsch in 1624.\n\nObject:\nThree of the five main Crux stars\u0097\u0096Acrux, Mimosa, and Delta Crucis\u0097\u0096are co-moving B-type members of the Scorpius-Centaurus Association, the nearest OB association to the Sun. They are among the highest-mass stellar members of the Lower Centaurus-Crux subgroup of the association, with ages of roughly 10 to 20 million years. 
CONST_HIS_CYG=History:\nThe constellation can be represented as looking like a wide winged, long necked bird, in graceful flight. In Greek mythology, it has been identified with several different legendary swans. Zeus disguised himself as a swan to seduce Leda, who gave birth to the Gemini, Helen of Troy, and Clytemnestra; Orpheus was transformed into a swan after his murder, and was said to have been placed in the sky next to his lyre (Lyra); and the King Cycnus was transformed into a swan.\nIn Ovid's Metamorphoses, there are three people named Cygnus, all of whom are transformed into swans. Alongside Cycnus, noted above, he mentions a boy from Tempe who commits suicide when Phyllius refuses to give him a tamed bull that he demands, but is transformed into a swan and flies away. He also mentions a son of Neptune who is an invulnerable warrior in the Trojan War who is eventually defeated by Achilles, but Neptune saves him by transforming him into a swan.\nCygnus, together with other constellations in the Zodiac sign of Sagittarius (specifically Lyra and Aquila, together with Sagittarius itself), may be a significant part of the origin of the myth of the Stymphalian Birds, one of The Twelve Labours of Heracles.\nIn Chinese mythology, the constellation Cygnus is the site of the once-a-year magpie bridge which connects the lovers Niu Lang and Zhi Nu (see Qi Xi).\n\nObject:\nAlbireo, a double star with blue and yellow components is at the "head". Deneb, its brightest star, is at the tail and is one star of the summer triangle. 
CONST_HIS_DRA=History:\nDraco is among the earliest of the constellations to have been defined; in one of the oldest known astronomical records, the ancient Egyptians identified it as Tawaret, the goddess of the northern sky in their pantheon of deities. Considered ever-vigilant because the constellation never set, she was depicted a fierce protective goddess whose body was a composite of crocodile, human, lioness, and hippopotamus parts.\nThe Greeks named it Draco the dragon. In one of the more famous European myths, Draco represents Ladon, the hundred-headed dragon who guarded the golden apples of the Hesperides. The eleventh of the Twelve Labours of Heracles was to steal the golden apples. He put Ladon to sleep with music, which enabled Heracles to freely take the golden apples. According to the legend, Hera later placed the dragon in the sky as the constellation Draco. Due to its position and nearby constellations in the zodiac sign of Libra (i.e. Ursa Major, Ursa Minor, and Bo?tes), the group of constellations can be seen to tell the tale of the eleventh labour.\nIn another Greek legend, Draco represents the dragon killed by Cadmus before founding the city of Thebes, Greece. In a third legend, it represents the dragon that guarded the Golden Fleece and was killed by Jason. The fact that the stars of this circumpolar constellation never set plays an important part in its mythologies.\nIn Roman legend, Draco was a dragon killed by the goddess Minerva and tossed into the sky upon his defeat.\nThe Arabs did not interpret the constellation as a dragon, seeing instead an asterism called the Mother Camels.\n\nObject:\nEltanin (Gamma Draconis) is the brightest star in Draco, with an apparent visual magnitude of 2.24.\nOne of the deep-sky objects in Draco is the Cat's Eye Nebula (NGC 6543), a planetary nebula that is said to look like a blue disc. There are several faint galaxies in Draco, one of which is the lenticular galaxy NGC 5866, sometimes considered to be Messier Object 102. Another is the Draco Dwarf Galaxy, one of the least luminous galaxies with an absolute magnitude of -8.6 and a diameter of only about 3,500 light years, discovered by Albert G. Wilson of Lowell Observatory in 1954.\nThe star Thuban (? Draconis) was the northern pole star around 2700 BC, during the time of the ancient Egyptians. Due to the effects of precession, it will once again be the pole star around the year 21000 AD. 
CONST_HIS_GEM=History:\nGemini was associated with the myth of Castor and Pollux, collectively known as the Dioscuri. One myth of these twins concerns cattle theft, and may be connected to early myths that described the Milky Way as a herd of dairy cows.[citation needed] On star maps, the twins are usually viewed as leaning away from the Milky Way, but are sometimes depicted with one of the twins residing in the Milky Way, and the other outside it, a situation making it appear that one of the twins is stealing the cattle, and the other is observing. Along with the other features of the area in the Zodiac sign of Gemini (i.e. Orion, Auriga, and Canis Major), this may be the origin of the myth of the cattle of Geryon, which forms one of The Twelve Labours of Heracles.\n\nObjects:\nGemini includes the Open Cluster M35. NGC 2158 is just southeast of M35. Also of note is the unique Eskimo Nebula, (also known as the Clownface Nebula) just southeast of the NGC 2420 open star cluster. Far northeast of this cluster lies NGC 2371, a planetary nebula next to the Gemini twin on the right. Another popular nebula in Gemini lies in the southern tip of the constellation, Abell 21 the Medusa Nebula. 
CONST_HIS_GRU=History:\nThe stars that form Grus were originally considered part of Piscis Austrinus (the southern fish), and the Arabic names of many of its stars reflect this classification.\nThe stars were first defined as a separate constellation by Petrus Plancius, who created twelve new constellations based on the observations of Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser and Frederick de Houtman. Grus first appeared on a 35-cm diameter celestial globe published in 1597 (or 1598) in Amsterdam by Plancius with Jodocus Hondius. Its first depiction in a celestial atlas was in Johann Bayer's Uranometria of 1603. Plancius chose the crane because that bird was considered to symbolise watchfulness.\nAn alternative name for the constellation, Phoenicopterus (Latin for flamingo), was used briefly in England during the 17th century. 
CONST_HIS_HER=History: \nThe constellation was not always identified with Heracles/Hercules. In earlier times, for example in the Rudolphine Tables, an alternative Greek name was Engonasin, meaning "on his knees" or "the Kneeler".\n\nObject:\nHercules has no first magnitude stars.\nMu Herculis is 27.4 light years from Earth. The solar apex, i.e., the point on the sky which marks the direction that the Sun is moving in its orbit around the center of the Milky Way on the third Wednesday of March , is located within Hercules, close to Vega in neighboring Lyra. 
CONST_HIS_LEO=History:\nLeo has been represented as a lion by numerous civilizations for thousands of years. One explanation is that the Sun was among its stars in Midsummer, and during this time the lions of the Egyptian desert left their accustomed haunts for the banks of the Nile, where they could find relief from the heat in the waters of the inundation. Pliny wrote that the Egyptians worshipped the stars of Leo because the rise of their great river was coincident with the Sun's entrance among them. Distinct reference is made to Leo in an inscription of the walls of the Ramesseum at Thebes, which, like the Nile temples generally, was adorned with the animal's bristles, while on the planisphere of Dendera its figure is shown standing on an outstretched serpent. The Egyptian stellar Lion, however, comprised only a part of the modern constellation, and in the earliest records some of its stars were shown as a knife, whereas they now are as a sickle. Kircher gave its title there as ???????????, Cubitus Nili.\nThe Persians called Leo Ser or Shir; the Turks, Artan; the Syrians, Aryo; the Jewish, Arye; the Indians, "Sher"; and the Babylonians, Aru - all meaning a lion. In Euphratean astronomy it was additionally known as Gisbar-namru-sa-pan, variously translated, but by Bertin, as the Shining Disc which precedes Bel, "Bel" being our Ursa Major, or in some way intimately connected therewith.\nIn Greek mythology, it was identified as the Nemean Lion which was killed by Hercules during one of his twelve labours, and subsequently put into the sky.\nThe Roman poet Ovid called it Herculeus Leo and Violentus Leo. Bacchi Sidus (Star of Bacchus) was another of its titles, the god Bacchus always being identified with this animal. However, Manilius called it Jovis et Junonis Sidus (Star of Jupiter and Juno).\nEarly Hindu astronomers knew it as Asleha and as Sinha, the Tamil Simham but later, influenced by Greece and Rome, as Leya or Loin, from the word Leo, as the Romans commonly called it.\n\nObjects:\nLeo contains many bright stars, such as Regulus (? Leonis), the lion's heart; Denebola (? Leonis); and ?1 Leonis (Algieba). Many other fainter stars have been named as well, such as ? Leo (Zosma), ? Leo (Chort), ? Leo (Al Minliar al Asad ), ? Leo (Alterf), and ? Leo (Subra). 
CONST_HIS_LEP=History:\nLepus is a constellation lying just south of the celestial equator. Its name is Latin for hare. Lepus was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 1st century astronomer Ptolemy, and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations. It is located below the constellation Orion (the hunter), and is sometimes represented as a hare being chased by Orion.\n\nObject:\nThere is one Messier Object in Lepus, M79. This is a faint globular cluster with a magnitude of around +8.56. 
CONST_HIS_LUP=History:\nIn ancient times, the constellation was considered an asterism within Centaurus, and was considered to have been an arbitrary animal, killed, or about to be killed, on behalf of, or for, Centaurus. It was not separated from Centaurus until Hipparchus of Bithynia named it Therion (meaning beast) in the 200s BC. No particular animal was associated with it until the Latin translation of Ptolemy's work identified it with the wolf.\n\nObject:\nLupus has no extremely bright stars, but has around thirty stars of second and third magnitude and 70 of greater than sixth, including a number of binary or multiple stars. Among the stars which make up the constellation figure, only a few are named stars, the brightest is ? Lupi, or Men, a blue giant. ? Lupi has the name Ke Kouan. 
CONST_HIS_LYR=History:\nIn the past, Lyra was often represented on star maps as a vulture or an eagle carrying a lyre, either enclosed in its wings, or in its beak. It was sometimes referred to as Aquila Cadens or Vultur Cadens (falling eagle or falling vulture).\nIn Greek mythology, Lyra was associated with the myth of Orpheus, the musician who was killed by the Bacchantes. After his death, his lyre was thrown into the river; Zeus sent an eagle to retrieve the lyre, and ordered both of them to be placed in the sky.\nIn Australian Aboriginal Astronomy, Lyra is known by the Boorong people in Victoria as the Malleefowl constellation.\nLyra was known as Urcuchillay by the Incas and was worshipped as an animal deity.\n\nObject:\n? Lyr (Vega): with an apparent brightness of 0.03m this is the second brightest star of the northern hemisphere (after Arcturus) and the fifth brightest star in all; its spectral class is A0 V and it lies at a distance of only 25.3 ly. 
CONST_HIS_MUS=History:\nMusca, under its original name Apis \u0096 the Bee, was introduced in the late 16th century by Petrus Plancius to fill the previously uncharted area around the southern pole and to provide nourishment for the nearby constellation Chamaeleon (17th-century celestial maps clearly show the chameleon's tongue trying to catch the insect). In 1752 Nicolas Louis de Lacaille renamed it to Musca Australis, the Southern Fly \u0096 Australis, since it counterparted the now discarded constellation of Musca Borealis composed of a few stars in Aries, and to avoid confusion with Apus. Today the name is simply Musca.\n\nObject:\nThe soft X-ray transient Nova Muscae 1991 is a binary object consisting of a star and a black hole. During the 1991 outburst which led to its discovery, radiation was produced through a process of positron annihilation. Musca also contains the unusual planetary nebula NGC 5189, located about 3,000 light years from earth. Its uniquely complex structure resembles a miniature crab nebula. 
CONST_HIS_ORI=History:\nOrion's current name derives from Greek mythology, in which Orion was a gigantic hunter of primordial times[13]. Some of these myths relate to the constellation; one story tells that Orion was killed by a giant scorpion; the gods raised him and the Scorpion to the skies, as Scorpio/Scorpius. Yet other stories say Orion was chasing the Pleiades.\nIn some depictions, Orion appears to be composed of three bodies, having three arms, two divergent legs, and a small central one, as well as the three bodies being bound at the waist. As such, together with other features of the area in the Zodiac sign of Gemini (i.e. the Milky Way, the deserted area now considered as the constellations Camelopardalis and Lynx, and the constellations Gemini, Auriga, and Canis Major), this may be the origin of the myth of the cattle of Geryon, which forms one of The Twelve Labours of Heracles.\nThe constellation is mentioned in Horace's Odes, Homer's Odyssey and Iliad, and Virgil's Aeneid.\n\nObject:\nBetelguese, known alternatively by its Bayer designation "Alpha Orionis," is a massive M-type red supergiant star nearing the end of its life. It is the second brightest star in the Orion constellation, but was mistakenly classified as the brightest because it is a semiregular variable star and was experiencing a tremendous increase in brightness at the time. It serves as the "right shoulder" of the hunter it represents (assuming that he is facing the observer), and is the twelfth brightest star in the night sky. 
CONST_HIS_PAV=History:\nPavo is a constellation in the southern sky. Its name is Latin for peacock. It is one of twelve constellations created by Petrus Plancius from the observations of Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser and Frederick de Houtman and it first appeared on a 35-cm diameter celestial globe published in 1597 (or 1598) in Amsterdam by Plancius with Jodocus Hondius. The first depiction of this constellation in a celestial atlas was in Johann Bayer's Uranometria of 1603.\n\nObject:\nIn Australia, part of Pavo is sometimes called "the Saucepan" when it is used as a guide to finding the south by the stars.\nThe most famous star in the constellation is ? Pavonis, a nearby Sun-like but more evolved star. ?2 Pavonis, another Sun-like star has an unconfirmed extrasolar planet. 
CONST_HIS_PSC=History:\nThe constellation is commonly represented as two fish, each of which is tied to the same point by a long length of string. The fish are connected at the tails. However, the 'strings' can also be interpreted as stick-figure men (with the 'fish' thus becoming their heads), and some forms of early Greek mythology viewed it as men bound to a point, with only the constellation Piscis Austrinus considered to be a fish.\nAccording to one Greek myth, Pisces represents the fish into which Aphrodite and her son Eros transformed in order to escape the monstrous Typhon; they are tied together with a cord on their tails, to make sure they do not lose one another.\n\nObject:\nThe Vernal equinox is currently located in Pisces, due south of ? Psc, and, due to precession, slowly drifting below the western fish towards Aquarius.\nPisces contains one galaxy that is listed in Charles Messier's catalog, named the spiral galaxy Messier 74. 
CONST_HIS_PSA=History:\nPiscis Austrinus, also known as Piscis Australis (/?s?tre?l?s/, Latin: southern fish) is a constellation. Its name is Latin for "the southern fish", contrasting with the larger Pisces, which also represents fish. Prior to the 20th century, it was also known as Piscis Notius. Piscis Austrinus was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 1st century astronomer Ptolemy, and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations. Its only bright star is Fomalhaut.\n\nObject:\nFomalhaut traditionally represents the mouth of the fish. Its companion Fomalhaut b is the first extrasolar planet ever detected by a visible light image, thanks to the Hubble Space Telescope. Beta PsA is the only other star in the constellation to have been named, being Tien Kang (heavenly rope) in China. It is also a binary, although of two nearly equal stars. 
CONST_HIS_SGE=History:\nIn the past, the constellation was called Sham; today, that name applies only to one star, ? Sge. The Romans named it Sagitta.\nThis constellation is one of those cases where Johann Bayer failed to name the stars in the correct order, in this case even degrading the brightest star to mere ?-status. Another example of such misjudgement is the constellation Sagittarius.\nIn Ancient Greece, Sagitta was regarded as the weapon that Hercules used to kill the eagle (Aquila) of Jove that perpetually gnawed Prometheus' liver. The Arrow is located slightly above Aquila the eagle.[citation needed] Others believe the arrow to be the one shot by Hercules towards the adjacent Stymphalian birds (6th labor) who had claws, beaks and wings of iron, and who lived on human flesh in the marshes of Arcadia - Aquila the Eagle and Cygnus the Swan, and Lyra the Vulture - and still lying between them, whence the title Herculea. Eratosthenes claimed it as the arrow with which Apollo exterminated the Cyclopes.\nSagitta was further interpreted by some as Cupid's Arrow or as an arrow shot by Sagittarius at Scorpius.\nOther interpretations consider the arrow to have been shot by Centaurus at Aquila, since Centaurus faces the correct direction and is at an appropriate angle to the arrow, whereas Sagittarius is immediately below it facing in the opposing direction (i.e. towards Centaurus).\nAs a result of the interpretations where Centaurus shot the arrow, may have come the myth in which Chiron (who was usually identified as Centaurus), having been painfully wounded by Herakles, gives up his immortality to rid himself of the pain, and takes the place of Prometheus, Herakles/Chiron then killing Aquila so that Chiron doesn't suffer as Prometheus did. As such, together with Lupus, this may have formed the basis of the tale of the Erymanthian Boar (which was one of Herakles' labours).\n\nObject:\n? Sge: also known as Sham, this yellow bright giant star of spectral class G1 II (with 4.37m) lies at a distance of 610 light-years and together with ? Sge (also 4.37m) forms either the feathers of the shaft or the two-pointed arrow once used in the Roman army. 
CONST_HIS_SGR=History:\nThe Babylonians, identified Sagittarius as the god Pabilsag (which had wings and a lion's head).\nIn Greek mythology, Sagittarius is identified as a centaur, half human, half horse. In some legends, the Centaur Chiron was the son of Philyra and Saturn, who was said to have changed himself into a horse to escape his jealous wife, Rhea. Chiron was eventually immortalised in the constellation of Centaurus, or in some version, Sagittarius. The arrow of this constellation points towards the star Antares, the 'heart of the scorpion'.\n\nObject:\n? Sgr (Rukbat) is not the brightest star of the constellation, having a magnitude of only 3.96.\nThis constellation contains the most stars with planets; 14 of its stars are known to have planets. 
CONST_HIS_SCO=History:\nThe brightest stars of Scorpius form a branched asterism that can be interpreted as the body of a scorpion.\nIn Greek mythology, Scorpius is sometimes identified with the scorpion sent by the goddess Gaia to kill the hunter Orion. The constellation of Orion is almost opposite to Scorpius in the night sky; it has been suggested that this was a divine precaution to forestall the heavenly continuation of the feud. In this version of the myth, Apollo sent the scorpion after Orion, having grown jealous of Artemis' attentions to him; later, in contrition for killing her friend, Apollo helped Artemis hang Orion's image in the night sky, but the scorpion was also placed up there, and every time it appears on the horizon, Orion starts to sink into the other side of the sky, still running from the attacker.\nScorpius also appears in one version of the story of Phaethon, the mortal son of Helios, the sun. Phaethon asked to drive the sun-chariot for a day. Phaethon lost control of the chariot. The horses, already out of control, were scared by the great celestial scorpion with its sting raised to strike, and the inexperienced boy lost control of the chariot, as the sun wildly went about the sky.\nIn Chinese astronomy, Scorpius is not a unified constellation; instead, its stars are included within the Azure Dragon, a powerful but benevolent creature whose rising heralded spring.\nIn Maori mythology, Scorpius is identified with Maui's magic jawbone, the front of Tama-rereti's waka (used to ferry the stars into the sky) or one of the posts Tane used to hold Ranginui (the sky-father) in the sky. While three posts (Sirius, Matariki/The Pleiades and Orion) hold up the top half of Ranginui, only a single post (Scorpius) supports the lower half of his body. It therefore appears bent under the weight.\nIn Polynesian lore, it is the "Great Fishhook" with which the gods pulled the islands out of the sea.\n\nObject:\nThe star ? Sco, after having been a stable 2.3 magnitude star flared in July 2000 to 1.9 in a matter of weeks. it has since become a variable star fluctuating between 2.0 and 1.6. This means that at its brightest it is the second brightest star in Scorpius. 
CONST_HIS_TAU=History:\nThe identification of the constellation of Taurus with a bull is very old, and may even be prehistoric. Michael Rappengl?ck of the University of Munich believes that Taurus is represented in a cave painting at the Hall of the Bulls in the caves at Lascaux, which he believes is accompanied by a depiction of the Pleiades, though his ideas have not been widely accepted. The paintings date to approximately 15,000\u009613,000 BCE.\nIn ancient Babylon, Taurus was called Sh?r. In Greek mythology, Taurus was identified with Zeus, who assumed the form of a magnificent white bull to abduct Europa, a legendary Phoenician princess. The tale informs the names of constellations since it is necessary to traverse the area of sky known as the Sea to reach it. When passing through the Zodiac, it forms the origin of the myth of the Cretan Bull, one of The Twelve Labors of Heracles.\n\nObject:\nBehind Aldebaran lie the Hyades, the nearest distinct open star cluster, that with it form a V, or an A, in the sky marking the bull's head.\nIn the west of the constellation lie the Pleiades, one of the best known open clusters, easily visible to the eye. 
CONST_HIS_UMA=History:\nUrsa Major was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 1st century astronomer Ptolemy. It is mentioned by such poets as Homer, Spenser, Shakespeare, Tennyson and Bertrand Cantat. The Finnish epic Kalevala mentions it, and Vincent Van Gogh painted it.\nThe constellation of Ursa Major has been seen as a bear by many distinct civilizations.\nIn Greek mythology, Zeus lusts after a young woman named Kallisto, a nymph of Artemis. Hera, Zeus's wife, turns Kallisto into a bear because of her jealousy. Kallisto, while in bear form later encounters her son Arcas. Arcas almost shoots the bear, but to avert the tragedy, Zeus sweeps them both into the sky, forming Ursa Major. In another tale, Ursa Major was associated with the Hesperides. With Ursa Minor, Bo?tes, Draco, and Hercules it may have inspired the myth of the Apples of the Hesperides, one of The Twelve Labours of Hercules.\nOne of the few star groups mentioned in the Bible (Job 9:9; 38:32; Amos 5:8 - Orion and the Pleiades being others), Ursa Major was also pictured as a bear by the Jewish peoples. ("The Bear" was mistranslated as "Arcturus" in the Vulgate and the error persisted in the KJV. Later translations have corrected this.)\nThe Iroquois Native Americans interpreted Alioth, Mizar, and Alkaid as three hunters pursuing the Great Bear. According to one version of their myth, the first hunter (Alioth) is carrying a bow and arrow to strike down the bear. The second hunter (Mizar) carries a large pot - the star Alcor - on his shoulder in which to cook the bear while the third hunter (Alkaid) hauls a pile of firewood to light a fire beneath the pot.\nIn Burmese, Pucwan T?r? (pronounced "bazun taja") is the name of a constellation comprising stars from the head and forelegs of Ursa Major; pucwan is a general term for prawn, shrimp, crab, lobster, etc.\n\nObject:\nSeveral bright galaxies are found in Ursa Major, including the pair Messier 81 (one of the brightest galaxies in the sky) and Messier 82 above the bear's head, and Pinwheel Galaxy (M101), a beautiful spiral northwest of ? Ursae Majoris. 
CONST_HIS_UMI=History:\nUrsa Minor is commonly visualized as a baby bear with an unusually long tail. The tail was said to have been lengthened from that usually expected for a bear, due to its being held by the tail and spun around the pole.(The center of the sky)\nUrsa Minor and Ursa Major were related by the Greeks to the myth of Callisto and Arcas. However, in a variant of the story, in which it is Bo?tes that represents Arcas, Ursa Minor was considered to represent a dog. This is the older tradition which sensibly explains both the length of the tail and the obsolete alternate name of Cynosura (the dog's tail) for Polaris, the North Star.\nPreviously, Ursa Minor was considered to be just seven close stars, mythologically regarded as sisters. In early Greek mythology, the seven stars of the Little Dipper were considered to be the Hesperides, daughters of Atlas. Together with the nearby constellations of Bo?tes, Ursa Major, and Draco, it may have formed the origin of the myth of the apples of the Hesperides, which forms part of the Labours of Hercules.\nIn earliest times, Ursa Minor was named the Dragon's wing, and was considered a part of Draco. The dragon's wing as an asterism is now long forgotten.\nIn other cultures, Ursa Minor was the hole in which the earth's axle found its bearing. In Hindu mythology, the Pole Star is Dhruva (the word means pole today), and there is a story behind him becoming a star.\n\nObject:\nUrsa Minor is colloquially known as the Little Dipper because its seven brightest stars seem to form the shape of a dipper (ladle or scoop). The star at the end of the dipper handle is Polaris, the North Star. \nPolaris (? UMi), the brightest star in the constellation, is a yellow supergiant shining at 2.02 apparent magnitude . It belongs to the rare class of Cepheid variable stars. Only a bit less bright is ? UMi (Kochab), a 2.08 orange giant star. 
CONST_HIS_VEL=History:\nVela is a constellation in the southern sky. Its name is Latin for the sails of a ship, and it was originally part of a larger constellation, the ship Argo Navis, which was later divided into three parts, the others being Carina and Puppis.\n\nObject:\nThe brightest star in the constellation, ? Velorum, is a bright 1.75m supergiant star. The star is actually quintuple, the primary component is famous for being the brightest Wolf-Rayet star in the sky. This star is also sometimes called Regor, which is Roger backwards. 
CONST_HIS_PER=History:\nPerseus is a constellation in the northern sky, named after the Greek hero Perseus. It was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 1st century astronomer Ptolemy, and remains one of the 88 modern constellations defined by the International Astronomical Union. It contains the famous variable star Algol (? Per), and is also the location of the radiant of the annual Perseids meteor shower.\n\nObject:\n? Per (Mirfak): The brightest and most brilliantstar of this constellation is also called Algenib (a name which is used for other stars as well, e. g. ? Peg). Mirfak (Arabic for elbow) is a supergiant of spectral type F5 Ib with an apparent brightness of 1.79m lying at a distance of ca. 590 light-years. Its luminosity is 5,000 times and its diameter is 62 times that of our Sun. 
CONST_HIS_PEG=History:\nPegasus is a constellation in the northern sky, named after the winged horse Pegasus in Greek mythology. It was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 1st century astronomer Ptolemy, and remains one of the 88 modern constellations.\n\nObject:\n? Peg (Markab), ? Peg, and ? Peg, together with ? Andromedae (Alpheratz or Sirrah) form the large asterism known as the Square of Pegasus. 51 Pegasi, a star in this constellation, is the first Sun-like star known to have an extrasolar planet. IK Pegasi is the nearest supernova candidate. Spectroscopic analysis of HD 209458 b, an extrasolar planet in this constellation has provided the first evidence of atmospheric water vapor beyond the solar system, while extrasolar planets orbiting the star HR 8799 also in Pegasus are the first to be directly imaged. 
CONST_HIS_OPH=History:\nThere exist a number of theories as to whom the figure represents.\nThe most recent interpretation is that the figure represents the healer Asclepius, who learned the secrets of keeping death at bay after observing one serpent bringing another healing herbs. To prevent the entire human race from becoming immortal under Asclepius' care, Zeus killed him with a bolt of lightning, but later placed his image in the heavens to honor his good works. It has also been noted that the constellation Ophiuchus is in close proximity in the sky to that of Sagittarius, which has at times been believed to represent Chiron (the mentor of Asclepius and many other Greek demigods), though Chiron was originally associated with the constellation Centaurus.\nAnother possibility is that the figure represents the Trojan priest Laoco?n, who was killed by a pair of sea serpents sent by the gods after he warned the Trojans not to accept the Trojan Horse. This event was also memorialized by the sculptors Agesander, Athenodoros, and Polydorus in the famous marble sculpture Laoco?n and his Sons, which stands in the Vatican Museums.\nA third possibility is Apollo wrestling with the Python to take control of the oracle at Delphi.\nA fourth is the story of Phorbas, a Thessalonikan who rescued the people of the island of Rhodes from a plague of serpents and was granted a place in the sky in honor of this deed.\n\nObject:\nThe brightest stars in Ophiuchus include ? Ophiuchi, called Rasalhague (at the figure's head), and ? Ophiuchi.\nRS Ophiuchi is part of a class called recurrent novae, whose brightness increase at irregular intervals by hundreds of times in a period of just a few days. It is thought to be at the brink of becoming a type-1a supernova. 
CONST_HIS_VIR=History:\nWho exactly Virgo was considered to represent is uncertain; in history, it has been associated with nearly every prominent goddess, including Ishtar, Isis, Cybele, and Athena, as well as with Mary the Mother of Jesus. Virgo may also feature, along with Ursa Major, and Ursa Minor, as part of the source of the myth of Callisto, either as Callisto herself, or as Hera. Persephone (who in some mythologies, notably the Eleusinian Mysteries, was considered to be a form of Demeter) is often mentioned as well, Virgo being visible mainly in the spring months when she was believed to have risen from the underworld.\nAccording to one interpretation, the constellation depicts Astraea, the virgin daughter of the god Zeus and the goddess Themis. Astraea was known as the goddess of justice, and was identified as this constellation due to the presence of the scales of justice Libra nearby, and supposedly ruled the world at one point with her wise ways until mankind became so callous she returned to the skies disgusted.\n\nObject:\nThe star 70 Virginis is one of the first known extrasolar planetary system with one confirmed planet 7.5 times the mass of Jupiter.
